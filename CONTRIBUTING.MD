Contributing
============

If you have a plugin, behavior, validator, or other functionality that you believe is generic enough and would improve the lives of others, please submit an issue or better yet, pull request! We want to avoid enforcing workflows on Kiln users, but we welcome more efficient ways to working with different types of content and use-cases.

## Other Ways to Contribute

- submit bug reports
- submit ideas
- write documentation: Did you struggle with a bug but managed to fix it yourself and learn something about `Kiln` in the process? Write documentation about it! Either write it in a Markdown file or submit an `idea` issue, if you want to contribute to the wiki.

## Notes on Documentation
We're trying to create two kinds of documentation: *reference* and *narrative* documentation. Reference documentation are for developers with familiarity with `Kiln` and need to look up something specific, like what API calls are available. Narrative documentation are walkthroughs or tell a story about how to implement functionality.


## Code of Conduct
*Modified from the [JSConf Code of Conduct](http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html)*

All contributors are required to agree with the following code of conduct. The project maintainers will enforce this code.

### The Quick Version

Contributing to Clay should be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of any contributors in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any public forum.

### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Contributors asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a contributor engages in harassing behavior, the project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the project.


### If you are experiencing harassment, please let a [project maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/clay/people) know!
