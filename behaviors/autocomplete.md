# autocomplete

Autocomplete can be added to any input field, and will allow users to easily select from provided options or add their own. It uses the `datalist` element, and thus works on all modern browsers except safari.

## Arguments

* **api** _(optional)_ api to point to
* **list** _(optional)_ list on the current site to point to

You can specify either a 3rd party api, or a specific list (e.g. `/lists/authors`) on the current site.
