# soft-maxlength

Appends a character count to an input. Allows the user to type above the limit, but can be paired with publishing validation to prevent publishing things that are too long.

## Arguments

* **value** _(required)_ number of characters that should be allowed

The character count will update as users type into the input, and will turn red if they type more characters than allowed.
